# Zoom Webinar Report Merger

This tool takes the Registration Report and Attendance Report generated by Zoom Webinars, cleans them up, and outputs a combined report that is easier to load into data analytics platforms.

## Features

- Merges Registration and Attendance reports
- Cleans and standardizes data
- Outputs a single, easy-to-use CSV file

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoom-webinar-report-merger.git
   cd zoom-webinar-report-merger
   ```

2. Create a new Anaconda virtual environment:
   ```
   conda create -n zoom-report-env python=3.8
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   conda activate zoom-report-env
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```
   conda activate zoom-report-env
   ```

2. Run the script with your Registration and Attendance report files:
   ```
   python webinar-report-merge.py path/to/registration_report.csv path/to/attendance_report.csv
   ```

3. The merged and cleaned report will be saved in the same directory as `combined_report.csv`.

## Batch Processing with process_all_webinars.py

For convenience in processing multiple webinar reports at once, we've included a script called `process_all_webinars.py`. This script automates the process of running `webinar-report-merge.py` on multiple pairs of registration and attendance reports.

### How it works

1. The script scans the `./input` directory for CSV files.
2. It looks for pairs of files with the following naming convention:
   - Attendance report: `attendee_{identifier}.csv`
   - Registration report: `registration_{identifier}.csv`
3. For each matching pair found, it runs `webinar-report-merge.py` with the appropriate arguments.
4. The script provides detailed logging of its actions and any errors encountered.

### Usage

1. Place all your raw webinar report CSV files (both attendance and registration reports) in the `./input` directory.
2. Ensure that `process_all_webinars.py` is in the same directory as `webinar-report-merge.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python process_all_webinars.py
   ```
4. The script will process all matching pairs of files and output the results in the default output location (as specified in `webinar-report-merge.py`).

### Features

- Automatically matches attendance and registration report pairs.
- Processes multiple webinar reports in a single run.
- Provides detailed logging for easy troubleshooting.
- Handles errors gracefully, continuing to process other files if one pair fails.

### Notes

- Ensure that your input files follow the naming convention: `attendee_{identifier}.csv` and `registration_{identifier}.csv`.
- The script assumes that `webinar-report-merge.py` is in the same directory.
- Check the console output or log files for any warnings or errors during processing.

This script is particularly useful when you need to process reports from multiple webinars, saving time and reducing manual effort.

## Concatenating Multiple Output Files

After processing multiple webinar reports with the `webinar-report-merge.py` script, you may want to combine all the output files into a single, comprehensive CSV file. The `concatenate_outputs.py` script is designed for this purpose.

### Usage of concatenate_outputs.py

1. Ensure that all your processed webinar report CSV files are in the `output` directory.
2. Run the concatenation script:

   ```
   python concatenate_outputs.py
   ```

3. The script will combine all CSV files in the `output` directory into a single file named `concatenated_output.csv` in the same directory as the script.

### Features

- Preserves the header (column names) from the first file.
- Concatenates data from all files, excluding redundant headers.
- Sorts files alphabetically before concatenation to ensure consistent order.
- Provides console output confirming successful concatenation or notifying if no CSV files are found.

### Notes

- This script assumes all CSV files in the `output` directory have the same structure (same columns in the same order).
- If your output directory is named differently, you can modify the `output_dir` variable in the script.
- The concatenated file will be named `concatenated_output.csv` by default. You can change this by modifying the `output_filename` variable in the script.

Use this script after running `webinar-report-merge.py` on multiple webinar reports to consolidate all the data into a single, easy-to-analyze CSV file.
