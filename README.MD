# Zoom Webinar Report Merger

This tool takes the Registration Report and Attendance Report generated by Zoom Webinars, cleans them up, and outputs a combined report that is easier to load into data analytics platforms.

## Features

- Merges Registration and Attendance reports
- Cleans and standardizes data
- Outputs a single, easy-to-use CSV file

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoom-webinar-report-merger.git
   cd zoom-webinar-report-merger
   ```

2. Create a new Anaconda virtual environment:
   ```
   conda create -n zoom-report-env python=3.8
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   conda activate zoom-report-env
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```
   conda activate zoom-report-env
   ```

2. Run the script with your Registration and Attendance report files:
   ```
   python webinar-report-merge.py path/to/registration_report.csv path/to/attendance_report.csv
   ```

3. The merged and cleaned report will be saved in the same directory as `combined_report.csv`.

## Concatenating Multiple Output Files

After processing multiple webinar reports with the `webinar-report-merge.py` script, you may want to combine all the output files into a single, comprehensive CSV file. The `concatenate_outputs.py` script is designed for this purpose.

### Usage of concatenate_outputs.py

1. Ensure that all your processed webinar report CSV files are in the `output` directory.
2. Run the concatenation script:

   ```
   python concatenate_outputs.py
   ```

3. The script will combine all CSV files in the `output` directory into a single file named `concatenated_output.csv` in the same directory as the script.

### Features

- Preserves the header (column names) from the first file.
- Concatenates data from all files, excluding redundant headers.
- Sorts files alphabetically before concatenation to ensure consistent order.
- Provides console output confirming successful concatenation or notifying if no CSV files are found.

### Notes

- This script assumes all CSV files in the `output` directory have the same structure (same columns in the same order).
- If your output directory is named differently, you can modify the `output_dir` variable in the script.
- The concatenated file will be named `concatenated_output.csv` by default. You can change this by modifying the `output_filename` variable in the script.

Use this script after running `webinar-report-merge.py` on multiple webinar reports to consolidate all the data into a single, easy-to-analyze CSV file.
